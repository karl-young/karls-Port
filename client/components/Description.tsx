            Welcome to my portfolio! I&apos;m Karl, a dedicated full stack web
            developer with a passion for creating innovative digital solutions.
            My journey into the tech world began with a bold decision to
            transition from a successful career in a prominent supermarket chain
            to pursue my passion for technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Driven by a genuine interest in software development, I completed an
            intensive 15-week bootcamp at Dev Academy, where I honed my
            technical skills and gained hands-on experience in building dynamic
            web applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to my technical expertise, I bring a wealth of soft
            skills cultivated through years of working with diverse teams and
            communities. I thrive in collaborative environments and believe in
            the power of teamwork to drive success in the ever-evolving tech
            landscape.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I embark on this exciting journey, I am eager to leverage my
            skills and contribute to cutting-edge projects that push the
            boundaries of innovation. My future is brimming with possibilities,
            and I am excited to see where this path leads.
          </p>
