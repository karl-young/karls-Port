              Welcome to my portfolio! I&apos;m Karl, a dedicated full stack web
              developer with a passion for creating innovative digital
              solutions. My journey into the tech world began with a bold
              decision to transition from a successful career in a prominent
              supermarket chain to pursue my passion for technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              Driven by a genuine interest in software development, I completed
              an intensive 15-week bootcamp at Dev Academy, where I honed my
              technical skills and gained hands-on experience in building
              dynamic web applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to my technical expertise, I bring a wealth of soft
              skills cultivated through years of working with diverse teams and
              communities. I thrive in collaborative environments and believe in
              the power of teamwork to drive success in the ever-evolving tech
              landscape.
            </p>
